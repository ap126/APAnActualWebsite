<p> Welcome to AP's "An Actual Website," where this blog/site is devoted to spamming you with some Kdramas (slight cringe)! See below for more and Kdrama opinions. </p>
 
<h1> Recent Updates </h1>
<p> Haven't got the opportunity to watch any of these yet, but they're on Netflix ;D ! Currently wishing for the day to binge watch :_( </p>
<p> Netflix features a YouTube channel with all their released Kdramas for Kdrama fans, called [The Swoon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpiCK8c6PBktcxq7Az_t4RQ) </p>

<h2> The School Nurse Files </h2>
<p> Released just recently! By watching the trailers and interview videos alone, I can tell that this is a creative + "cute" approach to Kdramas. The concept is very fresh! </p>

<h2> It's Okay to Not Be Okay </h2>
<p> IOTNBO (shortened name) has been attracting many viewers the past month via its interesting plot and the cryptic & girl-crush lead, Ko Moon-Young. My friends watched it and said it's pretty good :o </p>
